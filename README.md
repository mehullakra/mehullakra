## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github :)

Below are a few things that I take interest in:
- Perception algorithms for Autonomous Vehicles, Robots, etc.
- Creating Agents using LLMs
- Deep RL 

also generally interested in how machine learning works in every domain.  
  
my environment: 2025 Macbook Air (Apple M4), 16GB RAM  
  
Learning resources I really like:
